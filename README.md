# Getting Started with NodeJS Blog Test

This project was built with NodeJS, ReactJS + MaterialUI, MongoDB

#### ðŸ’ŽPassionately Crafted With ðŸ’–

## Notes

1. Some parts of the code could be simplified ( didn't have time ðŸ˜¥ ).
2. Card is **not** totally responsive.
3. Was unable to write tests for both client and server.

## Task Requirements

1. Update product through `client` **is not** implemented.

## Additional Requirements

1. Implemented realtime search for products on client.

## Preparing the project

You can follow these simple instructions;

1. Firstly extract the zipped file.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory using `cd`.

3. Run `bash start.sh` to automate `environment` setup, client and server `node_modules` folder installation, client and server asynchronous startup.

4. To view your saved data on `MongoDB Compass`, you can use this local db uri `mongodb://localhost/nodejsblog` and then click to connect.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` (client)

### `node` or `nodemon` (server)

To demonstrate the user requirement.

### `npm test` (client)

### `jest` (server)

Runs the test files.
